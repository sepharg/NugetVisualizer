# NugetVisualizer
Tool intended to help visualize all of the nuget packages and their corresponding versions for a set of given repositories

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sepharg/NugetVisualizer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sepharg/NugetVisualizer)

### Process

Initially, the data must be harvested. This can be done via the file system or by using the github API.
A console app is provided for testing purposes (and can be used as code examples on how to use)
Once the data is harvested, it can be visualized
All data is stored in a Sqlite database

### Configuration

A configuration.json file must be created to run the tests and the application.
The following variables are supported:

 - GithubOrganization : The name of the Github organization to read repositories from
 - GithubToken: OAuth token needed to connect to Github's API. You need to create a token and give it repo access. For more information, read more about [personal access tokens](https://github.com/blog/1509-personal-api-tokens)
 - Dbpath: This is the path where your Sqlite database will be created and the data stored. Do not include this variable in the UnitTests, as the DB is autogenerated.

### Initial setup

##### Database

Run the following command in a Windows prompt under Core\

    dotnet ef database update

This will create the database under the path defined by the *Dbpath* variable

##### Configuration

Create a file named configuration.json in the root of ConsoleVisualizer folder.
This can be used as a template:

    {  "GithubOrganization": "YOUR ORGANIZATION HERE",
       "GithubToken": "YOUR GITHUB TOKEN HERE",
       "Dbpath" : "full path to your sqlite database" 
    }

##### Running Tests Locally

Create a file named configuration.json in the root of the UnitTests folder. 

    {  "GithubOrganization": "YOUR ORGANIZATION HERE",
       "GithubToken": "YOUR GITHUB TOKEN HERE"
    }
